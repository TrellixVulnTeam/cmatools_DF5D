Numpydoc Sections in Docstrings

We organize Python docstrings into sections that appear in a common order.
This format follows the Numpydoc standard (used by NumPy, SciPy, and Astropy, among
other scientific Python packages) rather than the format described in PEP 287.

These are the sections and their relative order:

    Short Summary
    Deprecation Warning (if applicable)
    Extended Summary (optional)
    Parameters (if applicable; for classes, methods, and functions)
    Returns or Yields (if applicable; for functions, methods, and generators)
    Other Parameters (if applicable; for classes, methods, and functions)
    Raises (if applicable)
    See Also (optional)
    Notes (optional)
    References (optional)
    Examples (optional)
